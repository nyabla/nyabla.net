welcome to my digital garden! it's lovely to have you here.
my little space is a work in progress in terms of design and infrastructure
so expect to see things change about here from time to time.

i'm looking forward to implementing my own features and starting an evolving
writing practice. this will soon be full of notes and essays and messy ideas :)

my little posts are using this categorisation:

- seedling: for posts that are new and probably a little small
- sprout: for posts that have been through a few iterations and are getting a little bigger
- bloom: for posts that have been revised and matured.

each post has the date it was first created (planted), last updated (tended),
and its current status. the dates are formatted YYYY-MM-DD in UTC.

we'll see how this goes!
